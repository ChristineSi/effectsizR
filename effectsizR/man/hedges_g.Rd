Hedge's g for group comparisons

\description{
<ES estimate for group designs with a total sample larger than 20, comparing
two independent or dependent groups: Standardised mean difference calculated by
using the difference between the post-test means in the numerator of the equation
 and the standard deviation units in the denominator (pooled SDs are used to correct for possible
  upwards bias as especially problematic in samples smaller than 50). Standardisation
   permits direct comparisons across studies using the same index of effect.>
